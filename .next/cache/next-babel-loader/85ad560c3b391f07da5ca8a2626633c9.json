When faced with this difficult challenge,\n                nearly everyone we spoke to mentioned they felt as though they\n                have lost a significant amount of their independence.\n              </p>\n              <p className=\"text-xl text-gray-600 mx-auto mb-6 w-2/3\">\n                One part of this multifaceted challenge is the losing ability to\n                stand and the social, practical, and health issues that come\n                with it.\n              </p>\n              <p className=\"text-xl text-gray-600 mx-auto mb-6 w-2/3\">\n                In the spring of 2019, I led a team of engineers through the\n                design of a standing device and the development of a plan to\n                bring it to market. Our client was a med-tech startup company\n                based in San Diego, CA.\n              </p>\n            </Writeup>\n            <ProjectVideo projectName=\"soloStander\" number=\"1\" />\n            <Writeup>\n              <p className=\"text-xl text-gray-600 mx-auto mb-6 w-2/3\">\n                Our client asked us to design a standing device that was more\n                accessible and flexible for use outside of the house.\n              </p>\n              <p className=\"text-xl text-gray-600 mx-auto mb-6 w-2/3\">\n                We set off to interview users to find out what this meant to\n                them.\n              </p>\n              <p className=\"text-xl text-gray-600 mx-auto mb-6 w-2/3\">\n                Our biggest takeaways were that:\n              </p>\n              <p className=\"text-xl text-gray-600 mx-auto mb-6 w-2/3\">\n                • Current standing devices were too expensive.\n                <br />• Current standing devices were too heavy to use outside\n                of the house. <br /> • Insurance would not cover both a chair\n                and a standing device, so you would have to choose which device\n                to get. (almost everyone chose the standard wheelchair)\n              </p>\n            </Writeup>\n            <div className=\"flex\">\n              <ProjectImage projectName=\"soloStander\" number=\"1\" />\n              <ProjectImage projectName=\"soloStander\" number=\"2\" />\n            </div>\n            <Writeup>\n              <p className=\"text-xl text-gray-600 mx-auto mb-6 w-2/3\">\n                We used this feedback to design a device that was an aftermarket\n                attachment, as it works towards all of the most important\n                criteria mentioned above.\n              </p>\n              <p className=\"text-xl text-gray-600 mx-auto mb-6 w-2/3\">\n                • It’s lower cost to produce.\n                <br />\n                • It's a lightweight, temporary add on.\n                <br />• It allows users to continue using their expensive,\n                custom fit, wheelchairs.\n              </p>\n            </Writeup>\n            <div className=\"flex\">\n              <ProjectImage projectName=\"soloStander\" number=\"3\" />\n              <ProjectImage projectName=\"soloStander\" number=\"4\" />\n            </div>\n            <Writeup>\n              <p className=\"text-xl text-gray-600 mx-auto mb-6 w-2/3\">\n                Based on the commercialization plan and our estimates, our\n                client is positioned to profit $2.6M over the 5 years following\n                launch.\n              </p>\n            </Writeup>\n          </div>\n        </Layout>\n      </React.Fragment>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default App;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
